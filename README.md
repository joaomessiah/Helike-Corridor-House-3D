# **Helike Corridor House – 3D Reconstruction**
*A scientific reconstruction based on archaeological evidence and interpretative modelling*

This repository contains the open-access 3D reconstruction of the **Early Helladic II Corridor House from Helike (Achaia, Greece)**. The reconstruction was developed as part of the course *3D Visualization & Virtual Reconstruction* in the MA Archaeology programme at the University of Amsterdam. The project adheres to the methodological and reporting standards of the **4D Research Lab**, and its complete scientific documentation is available in the attached report.

The objective of this work is to explore how the **layout and circulation patterns** of the Helike Corridor House reflect **controlled access, spatial organization, and social differentiation** within the Early Helladic community. The full Blender file is openly accessible in this repository to support transparency, reproducibility, and future research.

## **Project Overview**

This reconstruction draws upon:

- Excavation data from the Helike Project  
- Excavation plans, trench drawings, and published documentation  
- Academic literature on Corridor Houses, Early Helladic architecture, and spatial behaviour  
- Comparative examples from EH II sites, including Lerna, Tiryns, and Akrotiri  

The 3D model focuses on circulation, access control, visibility, and the relationship between built space and social practice.

## **Paradata**

### **Architectural interpretation**
- Excavated portions of the first floor are modelled as **certain**.  
- Incomplete portions of the layout were inferred from parallels at Lerna, Tiryns, and Akrotiri (**moderately certain**).  
- Second-floor arrangement follows structural logic and EH II analogies.

### **Circulation and access**
- Only one staircase was reconstructed, supporting **restricted access** to the upper storey.  
- Spatial organization suggests social differentiation between residents and visitors.

### **Ritual or restricted spaces**
- Some rooms were modelled as potentially closable, in line with interpretations of ritual or selective-use spaces in corridor houses.

### **Doors and windows**
- Door locations correspond to gaps in trench drawings but remain **uncertain** due to limited evidence.  
- Door design is inspired by examples described by Maran & Kostoula.

### **Roof reconstruction**
- Roof structure is **highly interpretative** due to limited evidence.  
- Roof tiles are **moderately certain**, based on structural analysis indicating their probable use at Helike.

### **Material assumptions**
- Stone foundation  
- Mudbrick or plastered mudbrick walls  
- Wooden beams  
- Reed and rammed-earth ceiling layers  
- Ceramic roof tiles

### **Digital modelling decisions**
- UV mapping applied to all image-based textures  
- HDRI lighting for natural illumination  
- LoD 3 accuracy and clean geometry according to 4D Research Lab standards

## **Methods**

### **Data acquisition**
No scanning techniques (photogrammetry, LiDAR, etc.) were used. All inputs derive from excavation documentation and scholarly literature.

### **Modelling workflow**
- Import scaled excavation drawings  
- Trace foundation and extrude walls  
- Separate storeys into collections  
- Model roof beams, tiles, doors, windows  
- Add textures, UV mapping, and HDRI environment  
- Adjust lighting, camera, and rendering  
- Apply certainty colour scheme  

---

## **Uncertainty Levels**

### **Certain**
- Excavated first-floor foundations  
- Trench-based spatial layout

### **Quite certain**
- Staircase location  
- Some beam supports inferred from excavation remains

### **Moderately certain**
- Second floor and balcony  
- Roof tiles (existence supported, form unknown)

### **Not so certain**
- Ceiling layers (reeds, earth)  
- General roof structure

### **Very uncertain**
- Balcony beams  
- Detailed roof support logic  
- Door and window morphology  
- Upper-floor openings

## **Significance of the Reconstruction**

This model contributes to our understanding of:

- Controlled access and circulation within EH II architecture  
- Spatial differentiation between public, semi-public, and private areas  
- Potential ceremonial or ritual uses of specific rooms  
- The performative and hierarchical dimensions of Early Helladic social life  
- The monumentality and visual presence of Corridor Houses within their landscape  

By making the full Blender file openly available, this repository supports reproducibility, transparency, and future research in archaeological visualization.
